      <li>3.1
        <ul>
          <li>Node.js is the ground floor. It is the basics or platform on which one builds applications, while Express.js is a higher-level "framework" built on top of Node.js for buidling SPAs.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The package.json file is for specifying settings for your app. There is a bunch of fluff, but most importantly it specifies the name of the main app file and the dependencies.</li>
          <br>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3.2
        <ul>
          <li>The files are "static" because they are not being generated on the fly by the client, they are served up when the server is started.</li>
          <br>
          <li>It does not continue to serve up the "Hello World" message because there is already something being served at the same route: the html file.</li>
          <br>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
