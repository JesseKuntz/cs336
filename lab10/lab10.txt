1A. MongoDB can handle more diverse data types and really match up with any language, and can scale much better. MySQL can handle more complex, multi-row transactions.
1B. The cloud databases are always up, whereas a local database would only be accessible by my computer and only after I start it up.
1C. Not good for production. The mLab site actually tells us that there is no redundancy, which is not suitable for production.

2A. Just the npm start. We were just making changes to the server, not the React app, so there was no reason to build it like that.
2B. They are automatically changed on the application once the changes are made in Mongo.
2C. Because the data is easily stored as JSON and changes can be made quickly, (plus there could be tons and tons of comments) then noSQL is the way to go.
